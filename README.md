# Traffic Sign Recognition
# This project consists in building an image classifier for traffic signs.
# I used a convolutional neural network based on the LeNet model.

# The whole code is contained in the Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Backup.ipynb ipython notebook.

# The project comes with an explanatory memo: T1_02_Project_Memo.pdf
